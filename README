w3daytim is simple enough 'daytime' client for Windows 3.1+Win32s.
Is it still a thing?

Anyway, you can use it to set the clock of your VM, 486 PC, microwave at 
boot time.

It expects the date format exposed by OpenBSD inetd internal 'daytime' 
server: "+%a %b %_d %H:%M:%S %Y"

 Building
----------
To build this, you need the following:
* GNU make
* mingw-w64:     Any mingw version should work, since we're targeting crtdll 
                 and that's been supported even since the early versions.
* InfoZIP's zip: That is, if you want to build 'dist' packages.
* GNU awk:       same reason. mawk also works
* A bit of love for really old and useless things

 Running
---------
* Edit 'w3daytim.ini' to fit your needs
* Run the thing
